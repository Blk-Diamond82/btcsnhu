Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
  I'm just saying on task. I don't know how to describe it. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Any enhancements would require me to become more knowledgeable. With advanced skills in coding I could take the clock to the next level.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Working with the world clock was different. I could google how to execute it and include it in my code. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Learning the basics of C++ is just the starting point of my journey. The class was able to re-enforce my basic knowledge and build on that as well. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  There were a lot of errors. Making sure to take my time and work through all the bugs. It was so rewarding when it worked.
